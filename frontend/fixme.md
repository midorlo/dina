# TypeScript Build Errors (Resolved)

The previous build failures were caused by template type inference issues with dynamic route parameters and a misnamed Vuetify slot.

## Fix Summary

1. **Route Parameter Typing**
   - Replaced manual interfaces and casts with typed calls to `useRoute`.
   - Updated `<router-link>` usages to use named routes with parameter objects.
2. **Vuetify `v-img` Placeholder**
   - Replaced the deprecated `lazy-content` slot with the `placeholder` slot.
   - Removed the temporary `as any` cast.

Running `npm run build` now completes without TypeScript errors.
